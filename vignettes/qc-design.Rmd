## Introduction
Quality control (QC) is a foundational yet often implicit component of data preprocessing.
In many analytical workflows, QC is embedded informally within preprocessing steps or applied
in an ad-hoc manner without a clearly defined structure.

As data volume, dimensionality, and heterogeneity increase, this implicit treatment of QC
becomes increasingly fragile. Decisions about data inclusion, exclusion, or modification are
often made implicitly, without explicit documentation of the criteria or assumptions involved.

In *prepkit*, quality control is treated as an explicit and structured process that precedes
analysis-level preprocessing. QC is not intended to improve data quality or to optimize data
for downstream models. Instead, its purpose is to assess whether data are sufficiently reliable
to justify further processing and analysis.

This vignette documents the design principles underlying QC in *prepkit*. It focuses on
conceptual boundaries, processing order, and responsibility separation, rather than on
implementation details or step-by-step usage instructions. The goal is to make QC assumptions
explicit, auditable, and reproducible across datasets and projects.
